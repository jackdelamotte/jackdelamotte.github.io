          Hello, blog! It's been about a year since my first post so I thought
          it was time I make another contribution here :). My (last!) spring
          quarter at Cal Poly is underway, but I'm still reflecting on the things
          I learned last term. One thing in particular stands out as interesting which was using Scala and
          <a href="https://spark.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Spark</a>

          problems. RDDs, unlike MapReduce, are actually cool. To me it feels
          like the intersection of sleek higher-order functions
           and big data processing. I took a data mining
          class last quarter and let's just say that using Spark RDDs instead of
          lengthy python/pandas scripts could have saved me and my classmates
          both scraps of dev time and literal hours spent letting computations
          run (we were working with some large datasets). Another key advantage
          of Spark over another distributed model like MapReduce is that writing
          semi-complex queries can be pretty quick, for example, writing a
          K-Nearest-Neighbors classification algorithm in one (mostly) readable
          line is surprisingly straightforward, especially once you're familiar
          with some Spark tricks. Anyways, the real reason for writing this post
          is not just to talk about why Spark but more importantly, _how_ Spark.
          There's a lot of environments you could use but since I'm using Scala,
          IntelliJ was probably my best option. However, when looking for a
          tutorial on the web to Wiki-How me into RDD greatness, I was surprised
          I couldn't find any guides simple enough for me to get things running,
          so that's exactly what I hope to do; for any future students that run
          into this issue and somehow find my blog despite 0 SEO :). Here were
          my steps:
          <ol>
            <li>Download IntelliJ</li>
            You can get the community version
            <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/" target="_blank"
              >here</a>
            <li>Install the Scala plugin</li>
            There's a plugins tab on the side of the
            IntelliJ startup window. That's where you'll go to download the Scala
            plugin!
            <img src="SparkBlog1.png" width="80%"/>
            <br />
            <li>Create a new project</li>
            From the projects tab on the startup
            window, click “New project” and you should end up at a menu that looks
            like this.
            <br />
            <img src="SparkBlog2.png" width="80%"/>
            <br />
            Choose sbt as your project type. 
          
            <li>Choose your project specs</li>
            This is where I first ran into some issues. For some reason, I've only
            been able to get this to work with my sbt version set to 1.0.4, Java
            8, and Scala version 2.11.8 
            <br />
            <img src="SparkBlog3.png" width="80%"/>
            <br />
            <li>Build your project</li>
            When you click “finish”, your project should get created, be sure to give it a few
            seconds to extract the structure from the project specs and then you
            should be set. 
            <li>Get your build.sbt file right</li>
            The build.sbt file is
            where you include Spark from Apache and set your version, along with a
            couple other things. Here's the template that worked for me:
            <br />
            <img src="SparkBlog4.png" width="80%"/>
            <br />
            Once you have your sbt file setup, right click on it in the file
            navigator and select “build module *your app name*”, this process
            should only take a second.
            <li>Go crazy! </li>
            You should be all set to start
            using RDDs! Create a scala object (in src/main/scala) and use the
            following import: 
            <br />
            <code>import org.apache.spark.{ SparkConf, SparkContext }</code>
          </ol>
        </p>

          Hello. This is my first blog post! I know I'm about twenty years late
          to the blogging scene but if the
          <a href="https://indieweb.org/" target="_blank"> IndieWeb </a>
          movement gains any serious traction over the next few years
          (unfortunately, it won't) then I might just be a few years ahead of
          it's big resurgence. I'm actually half kidding, I think blogging is
          thriving on certain parts of the internet! I still like to read
          through a handful of personal blogs including those by
          <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/" target="_blank">
            Cal Newport </a
          >,
          <a href="http://antonkrupicka.com/blog/" target="_blank">
            Anton Krupicka </a
          >, and my friend
          <a href="https://www.thepringlesprogress.com/blog" target="_blank">
            Maddie Pringle </a
          >. <br /><br />
          Regardless of the current state of blogging and the web, I've decided
          this has the potential to be an enjoyable way for me to record some
          thoughts, develop a creative outlet, and express my agency and
          individuality in a way that is independent of the engagement based
          validation loops of modern social platforms. I'm not really sure what
          exactly I want to do with this blog yet. Maybe I'll write about
          running or other outdoor endeavors, college, books, or whatever is
          interesting to me at the time. Maybe someone will find it interesting,
          or maybe they won't. I guess that could be the simple beauty of a
          blog, freedom to write about whatever, for my own sake, and on my own
          terms.
          <br /><br />
          I don't feel as though I have anything particularly interesting or
          important to contribute to the infinite knowledge base that is the
          internet, but I think that's okay. I'm sure I'll continue to wrestle
          with the question of whether or not blogging is a worthwhile activity
          but for now, I think it will be fun! So let's see where this goes!
