          Hello. This is my first blog post! I know I’m about twenty years late
          to the blogging scene but if the
          <a href="https://indieweb.org/" target="_blank"> IndieWeb </a>
          movement gains any serious traction over the next few years
          (unfortunately, it won’t) then I might just be a few years ahead of
          it’s big resurgence. I’m actually half kidding, I think blogging is
          thriving on certain parts of the internet! I still like to read
          through a handful of personal blogs including those by
          <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/" target="_blank">
            Cal Newport </a
          >,
          <a href="http://antonkrupicka.com/blog/" target="_blank">
            Anton Krupicka </a
          >, and my friend
          <a href="https://www.thepringlesprogress.com/blog" target="_blank">
            Maddie Pringle </a
          >. <br /><br />
          Regardless of the current state of blogging and the web, I’ve decided
          this has the potential to be an enjoyable way for me to record some
          thoughts, develop a creative outlet, and express my agency and
          individuality in a way that is independent of the engagement based
          validation loops of modern social platforms. I’m not really sure what
          exactly I want to do with this blog yet. Maybe I’ll write about
          running or other outdoor endeavors, college, books, or whatever is
          interesting to me at the time. Maybe someone will find it interesting,
          or maybe they won’t. I guess that could be the simple beauty of a
          blog, freedom to write about whatever, for my own sake, and on my own
          terms.
          <br /><br />
          I don’t feel as though I have anything particularly interesting or
          important to contribute to the infinite knowledge base that is the
          internet, but I think that’s okay. I’m sure I’ll continue to wrestle
          with the question of whether or not blogging is a worthwhile activity
          but for now, I think it will be fun! So let’s see where this goes!
