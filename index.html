            <p>I'm a student at Cal Poly SLO where I'm studying computer science. On top of staying busy with
                a full schedule of classes, I've been challenging myself with learning within other contexts
                such as Cal Poly's UX/UI club and the Cru Central Coast software development team. Both of these 
                involvements have been incredible opportunities to pursue interests such as user experience, 
                and web development, as well as different ways to collaborate while doing so. (Like Figma or Git!)

            <p> When I'm not at a computer, chances are you can find me somewhere outside! Like most people, I
                like to keep active and for me that usually looks like running, climbing, or biking! And hey, I 
                know you didn't ask, but yeah, you can check out my latest Strava activity in the widget to the right!
